2. Graphql type
3. Graphql queries
    a. all
    b. individual
    c. responses from other queries taking into account this type
    d. client side queries
    e. test code for queries
4. Graphql Mutations
    a. create (response and args)
    b. responses from other mutations
    c. client side mutation responses and args
    d. test code for mutations
