Learning from GraphQL-example
1. dataloader npm package is to batch request server queries, works nice with graphql, will probably use
2. context is used in the express-graphql package, it is to authenticate users before query (or really just reference
their userId)
3.


For git:
set orgin: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42830557/git-remote-add-origin-vs-remote-set-url-origin
    `git status` to see if ready to add
    `git add .` to add all
    `git status` to see if added
    `git commit -m 'initial commit!'`
    `git pull origin master`
    `git push --set-upstream origin master`

NEW INSTRUCTIONS:
git init
git add . //(delete node_modules)
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/kevindanikowski/my_repo.git
git push -u origin master
input your username and password

Updating:
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push -u origin master ***only need to use -u once to set upstream so it knows where to pull from***

removing idea folder:
git rm -r one-of-the-directories

creating new branch: (remote-changes)
git checkout -b branch name
